1. Setup of the Power Automate connection in order to extract the data from outlook. '

This project was created based on the need of analyzing the data that we received through the team's shared email account. 
For this, a set-up connecting outlook with an excel spreadsheet using Power Automate was used. 
In doing so, we started parsing the data from outlook to an excel file.

2. Cleansing and transforming the data from excel
In order to be able to analyze the data and to do a deep analisis, the data was needed to be cleaned and filter out. 
Due to the nature of the work, it was important to extract the Purchase Order numbers that were in the emails received, along with relevant keywords

After a KPi report was created, this insighs were discussed with the team and some actions resulted from those KPIs. 

4. Power BI Dashboard (On progress)
Due to the increasing amount of emails received, an excel spreadsheet is becoming least convienent to use, hence the data is migrated to an online Sharepoint list where a dashboard using Power BI can be easily created.
